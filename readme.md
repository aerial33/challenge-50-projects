# 50 Projects in 50 Days 🏅

The goal of this repository it's to build every day a cool and simple project, like a cardio training.
Of course the code can be used in some projects you have.
There's no frameworks used just **HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT**.

For the resources I'd like to thanks Brad Traversy and Floren Pop.
The course who inspired me for this repo 👉🏼\_ **[50 Pojects](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/)**.
